=== Operating System
Use either Mac or Linux for development. Don't use Windows, don't even think
about it! There is always something working differently on Windows than on the
other platforms. This costs us huge amounts of time debugging problems instead
of developing valuable features.

If you are new to Linux, install {recommended-distro}. Make sure to read
{ubuntu-help}[the introduction to Ubuntu Desktop^], especially
{ubuntu-help}addremove.html[how the software installation work in Linux^].

NOTE: TODO: How to install distro?

// ==== Linux

==== macOS

Get a _i_**Mac**_Book_ _Pro_. macOS can run on non-Apple computer, it's called Hackintosh, but things can work differently there and it's against EULA. ðŸ˜ž

macOS has integrated App Store from which you can download some useful applications like XCode, Slack, and iWork (Pages, Numbers and Keynote) apps that came with your new Mac. You will use App Store to update the system, too.

macOS doesn't come with package manager as is `apt` in the Ubuntu. There are two options link:https://brew.sh[Homebrew] and link:https://www.macports.org[MacPorts]. The most used in our company is <<Homebrew>>.
