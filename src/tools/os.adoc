=== Operating System
Use either Mac or Linux for development. Don't use Windows, don't even think
about it! There is always something working differently on Windows than on the
other platforms. This costs us huge amounts of time debugging problems instead
of developing valuable features.

If you are new to Linux, install {recommended-distro}. Make sure to read
{ubuntu-help}[the introduction to Ubuntu Desktop^], especially
{ubuntu-help}addremove.html[how the software installation work in Linux^].

NOTE: TODO: How to install distro?

==== Linux

==== macOS
