=== Git
We use Git as a version control system. Our repositories are hosted on
https://github.com[GitHub^]. {git-book}[This book^] is a great Git tutorial,
read it.

We use {github-flow}[GitHub flow^] as our primary git workflow. Get familiar
with it.

Learn why https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/[readable commit messages
matter^]. And start using `git blame` daily.

Learn about `git add --patch`, `git reset`, and `git commit --amend`.

Become friends with `git rebase -i` and never merge _master_ into
your feature branch again.
