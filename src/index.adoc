= Programmer's Handbook

Welcome to Programmer's Handbook! It contains a list of tools, tutorials,
processes, and influential talks that we consider a healthy bottom line for
whatever we do. The rule here is: the local customs of the given project always
override whatever is written here.

== Influential talks

The following talks influenced how some very senior people in VL think about
programming. Watching these is a great way to use some
link:https://we.vacuumlabs.com/vacuum-book/delivery-life/#_learning_time[learning
time^]

=== link:https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy[Rich Hickey:
Simple made easy^] The great talk by Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure language.
The key message: being easy (I can do this with fewer keystrokes) is orthogonal
to being simple (I can easily reason what the code does).

=== link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc[Rich Hickey: Hammock Driven
Development^] Another great talk by Rich. The key message is surprisingly simple:
think before you code. Yet the talk is very influential and funny. The majority
of people don't live this elementary rule, and they waste a lot of their time.

=== link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0[Jack Diederich: Stop
Writing Classes^] Despite its name, the talk doesn't imply that OOP is bad.
Rather than that, it promotes writing short, readable code, avoiding premature
generalizations, working with pure values, and avoiding complex OOP structures.
It's funny and refreshing talk.

=== link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM[Brian Will: Why OOP is Bad^]
Brian gives a compelling argument that state encapsulation doesn't work: The
real systems are dominated by cross-cutting concerns. When faced with the
reality of real word programs, promises of encapsulation tend to be broken, and
object graphs quickly become tangled webs.

Apart from this, Brian does a very systematic breakdown of what Java has
brought, what are some good parts of it and why it thrives even though OOP is
bad.

=== link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjDsP5n2kSM&t=2169s[Jonathan Blow: How
to program independent games^] You don't succeed by using fancy data structure or
writing an algorithm that's a bit faster but buggy and fragile. Independent game
developer needs to be "extremely effective at getting things done".

=== Rich Hickey on immutable values versus references

- link:https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values[The Value of Values^]
- link:https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey[Are we
  there yet^]

This is Rich (again!) promoting immutable values and immutable data structures
over references that change over time in a mutable manner. Also, Rich talks
about the Epochal time model, where the whole (!) state of the program is
represented by a single mutable reference that takes a sequence of immutable
values, modeling a time-evolution of a state. This model is used with Redux
framework.

=== link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FihU5JxmnBg[Stuart Halloway: Debugging
with the Scientific Method^]

Be less chaotic and more organized when debugging. State explicitly what's your
hypothesis, test it, think. Write things down. Test one thing at a time. A good
process is more important than tools; scientific approach with console.log is
more powerful than ad-hoc trying random stuff with a strong debugger.

== Tools

=== Operating System
Use either Mac or Linux for development. Don't use Windows, don't even think
about it! There is always something working differently on Windows than on the
other platforms. This costs us huge amounts of time debugging problems instead
of developing valuable features.

If you are new to Linux, install link:http://www.ubuntu.com[Ubuntu^]. Make sure to read
link:https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help[the introduction to Ubuntu Desktop^], especially
link:https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/addremove.html[how the software installation work in Linux^].

// ==== Linux

==== macOS

Get a _i_**Mac**_Book_ _Pro_. macOS can run on non-Apple computer, it's called
Hackintosh, but things can work differently there and it's against EULA. ðŸ˜ž

macOS has integrated App Store from which you can download some useful
applications like XCode, Slack, and iWork (Pages, Numbers and Keynote) apps that
came with your new Mac. You will use App Store to update the system, too.

macOS doesn't come with package manager as is `apt` in the Ubuntu. There are two
options link:https://brew.sh[Homebrew^] and
link:https://www.macports.org[MacPorts^]. The most used in our company is
Homebrew.

=== Terminal

Learn link:http://linuxcommand.org/learning_the_shell.php[the basics of UNIX shell^].

Replace your default shell with much better one called _zsh_. Install
link:https://ohmyz.sh/[oh-my-zsh^], where you can select some nice visual theme for your shell.

I shared some stuff I'm using. A plugin called
link:https://gist.github.com/tomaskulich/2957cba62b241d362a0ea3324ea2f2f4[swissknife^] to make shell
more user friendly, my
link:https://gist.github.com/tomaskulich/1d212e6c9a9381f7f25368e519dc87ab[zsh theme]. I want to see more
than just a current folder's name on my prompt, but not the whole path either. Highly recommended is
also `git-prompt` plugin to give you better git status to your prompt (such as: such as how many
commits before and ahead of the remote my branch is.)

If you know any other cool tricks, please contribute!

=== Text Editor

==== Visual Studio Code

image::editors/screenshot-vscode.png[]

link:https://code.visualstudio.com[Visual Studio Code site]

Open source editor by Microsoft. It comes prepared for web-development with
integrated support for JavaScript intellisense, git integration and with many
plugins for popular frameworks.

===== Extensions

Extensions can be installed right in the editor. kbd:[Cmd+Shift+X] opens extensions sidepanel. If you prefer installing extensions using terminal then command is `ext install name-of-extension`. A name of the extension and the tile of it can be different.

=== Git
We use Git as a version control system. Our repositories are hosted on
https://github.com[GitHub^]. {git-book}[This book^] is a great Git tutorial,
read it.

We use {github-flow}[GitHub flow^] as our primary git workflow. Get familiar
with it.

Learn why https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/[readable commit messages
matter^]. And start using `git blame` daily.

Learn about `git add --patch`, `git reset`, and `git commit --amend`.

Become friends with `git rebase -i` and never merge _master_ into
your feature branch again.

[TIP]
===============================
In case you have your personal email set up in the global git config (`git config --global --list`), you can override it by including config file based on the current git directory.

global config `~/.gitconfig`
```
[user]
     name = Joe Srna
     email = joe.srna@gmail.com
[includeIf "gitdir:~/Projects/vacuumlabs/"]
    path = ~/Projects/vacuumlabs/.gitconfig
```

work related config `~/Projects/vacuumlabs/.gitconfig`
```
[user]
     email = joe.srna@vacuumlabs.com
```

You can verify the change by running `git config --list` within different directories.
