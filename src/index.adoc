= Programmer's Handbook

Welcome to Programmer's Handbook! It contains a list of tools, tutorials,
processes, and influential talks that we consider a healthy bottom line for
whatever we do. The generals rules are:

- Don't get trapped into dogma. Anything written here are suggestions, not commands
- Projects set their own engineering culture which may differ from whatever is written
  here.

== Influential talks

The following talks influenced how some very senior people in VL think about
programming. Watching these is a great way to use some
link:https://we.vacuumlabs.com/vacuum-book/delivery-life/#_learning_time[learning
time^]

link:https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy[Rich Hickey:
Simple made easy^] The great talk by Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure language.
The key message: being easy (I can do this with fewer keystrokes) is orthogonal
to being simple (I can easily reason about what the code does).

link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc[Rich Hickey: Hammock Driven
Development^]
Another great talk by Rich. The key message is simple:
think before you code. Yet the talk is very influential and funny. The majority
of people don't live this elementary rule, and they waste a lot of their time.

link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0[Jack Diederich: Stop
Writing Classes^] Despite its name, the talk doesn't imply that OOP is bad.
Rather than that, it promotes writing short, readable code, avoiding premature
generalizations, working with pure values, and avoiding complex OOP structures.
It's funny and refreshing talk.

link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM[Brian Will: Why OOP is Bad^]
Brian gives a compelling argument that state encapsulation doesn't work: The
real systems are dominated by cross-cutting concerns. When faced with the
reality of real word programs, promises of encapsulation tend to be broken, and
object graphs quickly become tangled webs.

Apart from this, Brian does a very systematic breakdown of what Java has brought to engineering
world, what are some good parts of it and why it thrives even though OOP is
bad.

link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjDsP5n2kSM&t=2169s[Jonathan Blow: How
to program independent games^] You don't succeed by using fancy data structure or
writing an algorithm that's a bit faster but buggy and fragile. Independent game
developer needs to be "extremely effective at getting things done".

Rich Hickey on immutable values versus references:

- link:https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values[The Value of Values^]
- link:https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey[Are we
  there yet^]

This is Rich (again!) promoting immutable values and immutable data structures
over references that change over time in a mutable manner. Also, Rich talks
about the Epochal time model, where the whole (!) state of the program is
represented by a single mutable reference that takes a sequence of immutable
values, modeling a time-evolution of a state. This model is used with Redux
framework.

link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FihU5JxmnBg[Stuart Halloway: Debugging
with the Scientific Method^]

Be less chaotic and more organized when debugging. State explicitly what's your
hypothesis, test it, think. Write things down. Test one thing at a time. A good
process is more important than tools; scientific approach with console.log is
more powerful than ad-hoc trying random stuff with a strong debugger.

== Tools

=== Operating System
Use either Mac or Linux for development. Don't use Windows, don't even think
about it! There is always something working differently on Windows than on the
other platforms. This costs us huge amounts of time debugging problems instead
of developing valuable features.

If you are new to Linux, install link:http://www.ubuntu.com[Ubuntu^]. Make sure to read
link:https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help[the introduction to Ubuntu Desktop^], especially
link:https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/addremove.html[how the software installation work in Linux^].

// ==== Linux

==== macOS

Get a _i_**Mac**_Book_ _Pro_. macOS can run on non-Apple computer, it's called
Hackintosh, but things can work differently there and it's against EULA. ðŸ˜ž

macOS has integrated App Store from which you can download some useful
applications like XCode, Slack, and iWork (Pages, Numbers and Keynote) apps that
came with your new Mac. You will use App Store to update the system, too.

macOS doesn't come with package manager as is `apt` in the Ubuntu. There are two
options link:https://brew.sh[Homebrew^] and
link:https://www.macports.org[MacPorts^]. The most used in our company is
Homebrew.

=== Terminal

Learn link:http://linuxcommand.org/learning_the_shell.php[the basics of UNIX shell^].

Replace your default shell with much better one called _zsh_. Install
link:https://ohmyz.sh/[oh-my-zsh^], where you can select some nice visual theme for your shell.

Disclaimer: Some tools may have hiccups when installing on zsh, for example bad env setup. If you
suspect this might be the case, try good old bash.

I shared some stuff I'm (Tomas Kulich) using. A plugin called
link:https://gist.github.com/tomaskulich/2957cba62b241d362a0ea3324ea2f2f4[swissknife^] to make shell
more user friendly, my
link:https://gist.github.com/tomaskulich/1d212e6c9a9381f7f25368e519dc87ab[zsh theme]. I want to see more
than just a current folder's name on my prompt, but not the whole path either. Highly recommended is
also `git-prompt` plugin to give you better git status to your prompt (such as: how many
commits before and ahead of the remote my branch is.)

If you know any other cool tricks, please contribute!

=== Text Editor

==== Visual Studio Code

image::editors/screenshot-vscode.png[]

link:https://code.visualstudio.com[Visual Studio Code site]

Open source editor by Microsoft. It comes prepared for web-development with
integrated support for Javascript and Typescript intellisense, git integration and with many
plugins for popular frameworks.

===== Extensions

Extensions can be installed right in the editor. kbd:[Cmd+Shift+X] opens extensions sidepanel. If you prefer installing extensions using terminal then command is `ext install name-of-extension`. A name of the extension and the tile of it can be different.

=== Git
We use Git as a version control system. Our repositories are hosted on
https://github.com[GitHub^]. {git-book}[This book^] is a great Git tutorial,
read it.

We use {github-flow}[GitHub flow^] as our primary git workflow. Get familiar
with it.

Learn why https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/[readable commit messages
matter^]. And start using `git blame` daily.

Learn about `git add --patch`, `git reset`, and `git commit --amend`.

Become friends with `git rebase -i` and never merge _master_ into
your feature branch again.

[TIP]
===============================
In case you have your personal email set up in the global git config (`git config --global --list`), you can override it by including config file based on the current git directory.

global config `~/.gitconfig`
```
[user]
     name = Joe Srna
     email = joe.srna@gmail.com
[includeIf "gitdir:~/Projects/vacuumlabs/"]
    path = ~/Projects/vacuumlabs/.gitconfig
```

work related config `~/Projects/vacuumlabs/.gitconfig`
```
[user]
     email = joe.srna@vacuumlabs.com
```

You can verify the change by running `git config --list` within different git-directories.
===============================

==== Credentials
For full access to our projects {ssh-key}[SSH key^] will be required. Add your public key to
{github-ssh-key}[Github keys^] and to our {google-doc-ssh-key}[internal Google Doc^]. If you don't
have one, you will need to {generate-ssh-key}[generate it^].

[TIP]
===============================
If you've set up SSH keys on your personal computer before onboarding, you will need to generate a
new key, or copy contents `~/.ssh` folder from your personal to your work laptop.
===============================

It is also useful to {gpg-key}[generate GPG key^]. This will result in better security, a more
professional look, and a [green]*Verified* badge that some open-source projects require. After
generating you will also need to add this key to {github-ssh-key}[Github keys^] and enable
{gpg-signing}[GPG signing^].

== VL and functional programming

=== Use pure functions

We often say that in VL we do functional programming. Sure, function is a great concept. If a
language has functions, you can easily model all OOP concepts such as inheritance. This doesn't work
the opposite way round so easily.

The best kind function is pure function. That's one that does not depend on anything from the
outside world. Furthermore, pure function shouldn't mutate its arguments and should use solely the
return statement to communicate the result to the caller.

Pure function can be tested and reasoned about in isolation. Therefore the second code snippet is a
way more preferred to the first:

```
// don't do this
function main() {
  function this_is_hard_to_test(filename) {
    const data = read_data_from_file(filename)
    do_something_with_data
    return something
  }
  this_is_hard_to_test('data.txt')
}

// do this
function main() {
  const data = read_data_from_file('data.txt')
  function this_is_better(data) {
    do_something_with_data
    return something
  }
  this_is_better(data)
}
```

Don't get trapped by dogma here: many tasks can not be easily addressed using only 100% pure functions.
Be ready to conduct some side-effects, read (and sometimes even modify) variables from the outer scopes,
etc. The learning here is, that you should pursue the purity to the reassonable level.

As an example, Haskell takes purity really seriously and perform side-effects by monads. Monads
seemingly make all functions pure, but in reality, it's the kind of purity that costs you a lot -
while not buying you better testability, it doesn't make reasoning about the code easier either.

=== Prefer simple data structures

In Java-ish languages one often defines structures like this:

```
class Person {
  first_name: String
  last_name: String
  function full_name() : String {
    return this.first_name + ' ' + this.last_name
  }
}

const me = new Person(...)
```

In JS, TS, Clojure the second approach is very common:

```javascript
const me:Person = {first_name: "Tomas", last_name: "Kulich"}

function person_full_name(person) {
  return person.first_name + ' ' + person.last_name
}
```

The second approach works very well, especially with simpler structures. The reason is, that there
are already many excellent battle-tested libraries that work for plain structures. Say you need to
determine, whether two Persons are deeply equal. In the Java case, you need to write (or
auto-generate, sigh) a custom .equals method and compare the objects field-by-field. With the second
approach and Javascript, you can use `lodash.equals` for deep-equality checks.

But there's much more: `lodash.deepCopy` gives you (customizable) deep copying, `lodash.merge` gives
you deep updates, there's out-of-the-box (de)serialization with JSON.stringify and JSON.parse, there's an
immutability helper to ease your work with object in an immutable manner, etc...
Implementing this yourself for your custom Person class is a huge vaste of time and space for bugs.

The learning is: study libraries such as lodash for Javascript (or just get familiar with built-in
language features for Python and Clojure). Anytime you're like "hey, I'm forced to implement
something that feels like a more general object-manipulation", pause and reflect on your design.

=== Immutable data structures

Think of a typical String or Date implementations. Usually (Java, Python, JS), these are immutable
objects; one can construct new string such as `my_string + "!"` but there is no way mutating the
string, e.g. no `my_string.append("!")` exist. This brings a great relief when reasoning about Strings:
if I see `my_string` variable somewhere, I can trust that no matter who else keeps the reference to
the same string, the stuff is not going to change.

It's natural to strive for the immutability benefits also with Maps, Lists (and Objects). In JS
there are several easy ways how to update the object in an immutable manner:

```javascript
const updated_user = {...user, name: new_name}
// or this one, ideal for nested objects
const updated_user = immutability_helper.update(user, {name: {$set: new_name}})
```

There exist immutable data structures implementation (Map, List) that do this in a very performant
manner (time complexity `O(lg(structure_size))`). However, unless the language has built those
directly to SDK (Clojure), it's more practical just to stick to good old mutable objects (unless they are
huge) and not mutating them just by convention.

=== Stay pragmatic

There are many wrong things to optimize for:
- extreme purity,
- coding the idiomatic [your favorite framework] way,
- 100% test coverage,
- your code behaving 100% correctly even in unlike and unimportant situations, etc...

We're solving real problems. Focus on "what's the problem we're trying to solve here" rather than "what's
the most idiomatic way to achieve this in framework X".

This doesn't advocate writing shitty code. Saving 30 minutes of your time just to create a day long
debug session for yourself is certainly not pragmatic.

=== Avoid premature optimization and premature generalizations

Always be aware of how much resources (time, memory) you can waste, so you can waste them wisely.
With time, be aware of what's the most time-consuming thing that's happening and ignore everything
else, preferring readability to unimportant time-saving. If a reviewer asks you to optimize O(n) work
in O(n**2) algorithm while making the code a bit less readable, push back.

Be very humble when predicting what new features will be needed. Even if you're right that X
will be needed in 2 months, the prefered way how to achieve X is likely to change by that time. And
even if you're completely right about all your predictions, it'll still may be easier postpone X for
later, since you won't need to maintain X for 2 extra months.

=== Produce bug-free code by avoiding bugs

Imagine you write 100 lines. You hit run and--it's working! What a feeling! Some people do it
differently: they quickly produce 100 lines of bad code, then using print and debugger they get the
code in shape. Not only this feels worse, in the end, it's also much more time consuming; not even
mentioning the nasty bugs that the latter approach usually produces.

If you fall into the second case, consider changing your workflow. Slow down and focus on writing
high-quality code. Reason why the code should work ("On this place, the connection must be already
opened, because I jump here only from here and here... wait, also from here! Oh my, that'd be a
nasty bug to have."). Play a "coding game": If the code runs correctly on the first time (possibly
after fixing small and easy bugs such as typos), you've won. Soon you develop a healthy amount of
paranoia, which'll make you question your code all the time. You'll produce a code 3x slower but also
10x faster.

=== Test are good, if they add value

How to write tests is almost a religious thingy, contained by several though schools. Stay away from the
dogmatic mess they've created; simple pragmatism is the best guidance. If the test adds value that
outweighs the cost (writing, maintaining and running the test), then it's a good test to have.

Imagine such a test:
- you populate a User object with data,
- save the obejct to the database,
- load an object from DB,
- assert that all attributes are correctly loaded.

The test has a low value and probably doesn't pull its weight:
- it's testing a relatively simple code; it'd be easier to review it manually,
- the code is not likely to break,
- if test passes, it doesn't tell you much; there are many edge cases (e.g. very long user name), that are
  not covered,
- if test fails, you'd probably find out anyway really soon,
- it doesn't serve as a documentation.

=== Code reviews are awesome

Code reviews are the best tool we have to produce a bug-free, readable and maintainable code. Often, more
than one review is required.

Few tips:

- Don't enforce your taste to others too much. If you know shorter form of how to write something
  but you're not sure, just give advice: "consider rewriting to ...".
- This sucks: correcting 10 OKish namings just because it's easy to do and missing a huge design
  flaw at the same time.
- If you've had an objective problem understanding something and author had to explain it to you, it
  probably deserves a comment.
- If it's for a longer discussion, schedule a call or just pick up the phone and call the other
  person.
- If you as a senior spend too much time correcting rookies' mistakes in juniors' codes, consider
  changing the process: let juniors first peer-review the code and only then there's a PR with you
  involved. Among other benefits, this'll elevate the cost for writing a shitty code, so people will
  soon stop using you as an oracle and they start thinking for themselves.

Finally, if it's not clear why the code works correctly, you shouldn't merge it. Author can use
different ways to persuade you she did a good job:

- adding explanatory comments,
- writing tests, demonstrating the desired functionality,
- structuring a code in a way, that certain behavior is enforced by design,
- Q: "hey, I'm not sure about this", A: "Me neither, but I've tested it manually and it seems to
  work. It's poorly documented, so it'll do for now I guess."

The code review process we usually use looks like this:

- Reviewer comments to the PR.
- Author reacts :thumbsup:, if he accepts the proposed change. If it's something more complex, the
  discussion can take place. Tip: avoid writing comments for anything more complicated. It's
  inefficient and frustrating. Have a quick call instead.
- Reviewer checks that she likes the outcome by clicking "mark as resolved".
- If reviewer has only cosmettic comments, she can approve the PR indicating he doesn't care that
  much which suggestions author implements.

Bad practices:

- Leave the comment without any reaction.
- Resolving the reviewer's comment by the author in a case where author is not 100% sure he fixed it
  in a way reviewer intended.

The changes are usually pushed as a new "fixing PR comments" commit to the feature branch. This
allows the reviewer to see the edits in the fixing commit, or see the whole proposed change in the
feature branch. For this to work, the feature branch shouldn't contain more than one logical change.
Also, the "fixing PR comments" commits are not useful after the branch is merged--therefore the
feature branch should be squashed to a small number of commits (often just one) before merging.

Another approach is: you can put more than one atomic change into a branch. In such a case, one
atomic change gets represented by one commit. The reviewer reviews the branch commit-by-commit and
when she requires change, author edits the history. Reviewer doesn't see the correcting diff itself,
but can then check out her comments, the current state of the code and see, if the code looks good
now. Pros: it works better for doing several tasks simultaneously. For example, you start coding a
feature, refactor something on-the-fly and fix a bug you discover. It's much easier to have just one
branch for that. Cons: reviewer doesn't see an exact diff, that author produced to implement their
change.

To sum it up: each approach has its pros and cons, as always, you should study, adapt (and
maybe challenge) the customs on your project.

=== Microservices are often overused

There's a too big hype around microservices. Obviously, the world doesn't run as one monolithic
service (and that's a good think). Since "big project" ==  "small world", it's not a good idea for a
big project to run as a monolithic service either. Structuring the project to smaller microservices
helps--as long as the microservices have well-defined responsibilities and the cross-cutting
concerns are limitted.

Unhealthy hype about microservices gave birth to systems with too many microservices and a lot of
incidental complexity. Keep the number of microservices small and create them only after you're
pretty certain that such a service makes sense; don't be affraid to start with monolithic design and
then carve-out a few services later.

=== Monorepo is a better idea than newcomers usually think

This is somewhat similar to microservices. The world isn't in one giant GIT repo, but there's a lot
of cost if your production requires running a code from 20 different repos. If you think "we're too
big for a simple repo", then consider the whole Google codebase lives in a single repository; they
have a lot of tooling built around it, and as your system evolves, you'll probably need to build
some custom tooling as well.

=== Fat code is good
When you start coding, you name your variables `i`, `j`, `k`. Then you code a project with 10k lines
and you discover using better names such as: `user`, `account`, `amount` or `transfer()` is good
for your sanity.
Then you code a project with 100k lines, discovering you need even better names:
`account_sender_or_system_account`,
`amount_USD_before_VAT`, `try_transfer_with_SEPA()`. Often people use
short and imprecise names that kick their ass badly, once the project grows.

Good type system can help you shorten the names of your variables and parameters, since a lot of
info is just to describe the type. This is not always possible, especially for functions you should
be quite verbose.

Using long names results in writing a fat code: simple expression such as `a = b + c + d` can overflow the
100 characters limit, which looks ugly and not that readable. However, this is usually a less severe
problem than one may think.

=== Comments

John produces a code. During code review, Jane doesn't understand a certain line, which creates the
communication such as:

Jane: What if `user` parameter is not provided?
John: Actually, it's always provided.
Jane: Why is the parameter declared as optional then?
John: Ah, I see your point. It's optional just for the tests. Production code always puts the value there.
I've just checked and it's really like that.
Jane: OK then. Ship it.

Then the code gets merged. But can you spot the process flaw? Jane had a valid question and John
answered it. However, no one thought about 20 other team members that'll encounter that line of
code. They'll be as lost as Jane, without any clue, why the code is like that.

As a rule of thumb, when explaining more complected or suspicious code to the curious reviewer,
consider adding a comment such as:

```
// Parameter `user` is actually required. It's marked optional just because of tests.
```

Another case, that always deserves a comment: copy-pasting code from somewhere. Always add a link to
where the code came from.

Fixing a nasty hidden bug, also deserves a comment:

// This needs to happen _before_ the transfer is invoked. Otherwise, the callback, can see the
// structure not initilized and errors.

=== Idempotency

Imagine a service that allows you to create new transactions as such:

```javascript
external_service.add_new_transaction({from: "john", to: "jane", usd_amount: 10})
```

To handle possible errors, you need to add some try-catch logic:

```javascript
try {
  external_service.add_new_transaction({from_account: "john", to_account: "jane", usd_amount: 10})
} catch (err) {
  // what now?
}
```

How would you handle the error? You may want to repeat the transaction:

```javascript
function try_send_transaction_with_repeat({from_account, to_account, usd_amount, try_this_many_times}) {
  // default value
  try_this_many_times = try_this_many_times || 10
  try {
    external_service_do_your_job
  } catch (err) {
    if (try_this_many_times > 0) {
      wait(10000)
      try_send_transaction({from_account, to_account, usd_amount, try_this_many_times - 1})
    } else {
      // pun intended
      throw Error('sa mi neda poslat')
    }
  }
}
```

If you call this with `try_this_many_times === 10`, you'll get 10 tries in 10s intervals and then
error is thrown. But what if try_send_transaction actually _created_ the transaction on the external
service and just then something failed, when sending the response back (e.g. parsing the response on
your server is faulty)? You'd end up with 10 transaction being created: uh-oh.

To overcome this, decent external services let you specify so-called _idempotency key_ which serves
as unique identifiers to your request. If the external service is decent, you can use it as such:

```javascript
function try_send_transaction_with_repeat({from_account, to_account, usd_amount, try_this_many_times, idempotency_key}) {
  // default values
  try_this_many_times = try_this_many_times || 10
  idempotency_key = idempotency_key || uuid()
  try {
    external_service_do_your_job(..., idempotency_key)
  } catch (err) {
    if (try_this_many_times > 0) {
      wait(10000)
      try_send_transaction({from_account, to_account, usd_amount, try_this_many_times - 1, idempotency_key})
    } else {
      // pun intended
      throw Error('sa mi neda poslat')
    }
  }
}
```

This is guaranteed to create one or none transaction.
